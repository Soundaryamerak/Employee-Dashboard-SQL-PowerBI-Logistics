Targeted Retention Programs:

Develop targeted retention programs for departments with high attrition rates, such as Development and Sales, to address specific issues within these areas.
Employee Engagement Initiatives:

Implement employee engagement initiatives, such as regular feedback sessions, career development opportunities, and recognition programs, to boost morale and reduce turnover.
